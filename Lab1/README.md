to free memory for BST, initiating the NODE, adding name to file, sorting alphabetically and inserting the names into the BST

'bstDemo' is the BST demo itself where main is located, main functions of the bst

'bst.h' implements the structs and calls for necessary methods

'Makefile' consists of the processes of compiling all and cleaning if needed to
	  // Code was used from Dr. Freudenthal(UTEP) to make adjustments
	   and program run smoothly.

'stateManager' is the optinal main menu interface


To compile and run:
   $make run

To clean:
   $make clean
